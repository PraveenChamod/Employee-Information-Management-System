## Project Development
Instead of saving the documents in a drive, have them in a single place against respective employees, I've planned implement this system for using both employees and Admin can use them whenever they want to. With the self-service option for the employees, they can change their personal and professional information, view their time-off reports, or look into appraisal history.
